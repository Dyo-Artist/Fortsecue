Use Case Document
Product: LOGOS – Cognitive Engine + Stakeholder Engagement MVP
________________________________________
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This document describes the primary use cases for:
•	LOGOS Core (the cognitive engine and shared AI pipelines), and
•	The Stakeholder Engagement MVP that runs on LOGOS Core.
It focuses on user-visible behaviour and interactions with the system; technical design details are covered in the SRS, AI Model Design, and SAD.
1.2 Scope
Use cases in scope:
•	Ingesting and processing stakeholder interactions (documents, audio, notes).
•	Reviewing and committing extracted data into the LOGOS graph.
•	Searching and exploring stakeholders, projects, and commitments.
•	Managing commitments and viewing alerts.
•	Viewing project maps and stakeholder networks.
•	Basic configuration and operations relevant to MVP.
Advanced modules (ESG analytics, governance workflows, predictive modelling, etc.) are out of scope for this version but should be supported by the same patterns.

4. Detailed Use Cases
________________________________________
UC01 – Ingest Stakeholder Interaction from Document
Primary Actor: Business User
Goal: Convert meeting notes or correspondence (DOCX/PDF/TXT/CSV) into structured interactions, stakeholders, commitments, and issues.
Preconditions:
•	LOGOS is running and accessible via UI.
•	User has a document containing stakeholder-related content.
•	User is authenticated (if auth is enabled).
Postconditions (on success):
•	A new provisional Interaction exists in staging with extracted entities and relationships.
•	User can see a preview and proceed to UC04.
Main Success Scenario:
1.	User opens the “Upload Interaction” screen.
2.	User selects and uploads a document (DOCX/PDF/TXT/CSV).
3.	System validates file type and size.
4.	System stores the file in staging and creates a temporary interaction_id.
5.	System extracts text from the document.
6.	System passes text to LOGOS Core NLP pipeline.
7.	LOGOS Core returns an extraction bundle (stakeholders, commitments, issues, sentiment, topics).
8.	System runs normalisation/entity resolution against existing graph.
9.	System stores a preview bundle linked to interaction_id.
10.	System notifies user that a preview is ready and opens the preview view (UC04).
Extensions / Alternatives:
•	3a. Unsupported file type
o	3a1. System rejects the file with a clear error and supported types list.
•	5a. Text extraction fails (e.g. corrupted file)
o	5a1. System flags error and logs details.
o	5a2. User is prompted to upload a different file or paste text (UC03).
•	7a. NLP pipeline unavailable (temporary failure)
o	7a1. System shows error and leaves interaction in “failed” state.
o	7a2. User can retry later.
Frequency of Use: Daily, multiple times per user.

UC02 – Ingest Stakeholder Interaction from Audio
Primary Actor: Business User
Goal: Convert recorded meetings or calls (audio files) into structured interactions.
Preconditions:
•	LOGOS is running and configured with a local ASR service or stub.
•	User has an audio recording they are permitted to use.
Postconditions:
•	A new provisional Interaction with transcript and extracted entities/relationships exists in staging.
•	User can proceed to UC04.
Main Success Scenario:
1.	User opens “Upload Audio” screen.
2.	User uploads an audio file (e.g. WAV, MP3).
3.	System validates file type and size.
4.	System stores audio file and creates interaction_id.
5.	System sends audio to local ASR service.
6.	ASR returns transcript text.
7.	System passes transcript to NLP pipeline (same as UC01 steps 7–9).
8.	System saves preview bundle for interaction_id.
9.	System opens preview (UC04).
Extensions:
•	5a. ASR service unavailable or times out
o	5a1. System logs error and notifies user.
o	5a2. User may download transcript error log or try again later.
